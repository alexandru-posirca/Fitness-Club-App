## üìù General Info

* The idea to develop this project came from my own great passion for fitness, where I wanted to develop in my vision a personalized way through which a person can sign up for a fitness membership.
* This website is based on **making a personalized fitness subscription**, following a complex fully configurable form, the user must be logged into the account, to be able to **sign up** and access the **subscription** information.
* To integrate authentication into the site, I used the **Firebase** service, implementing through **Google Auth**, the functionality provided by it.
* I used this backend service to store the database in realtime for all the subscriptions of users registered in the fitness club, from where I can further manage their request.
* The design was implemented based on the Figma resource that I have attached below.
* To test the site's **functionality to its maximum capacity**, you must press the **Join Club Now button**, and then authenticate with Google Auth, either with the personal account or with the **Google TEST account** that I provide.
