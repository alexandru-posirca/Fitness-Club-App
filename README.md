This website is based on **making a personalized fitness subscription**, following a complex fully configurable form, the user must be logged into the account, to be able to **sign up** and access the **subscription** information.

To test the site's **functionality to its maximum capacity**, you must press the **Join Club Now button**, and then authenticate with Google Auth, either with the personal account or with the **Google TEST account** that I provide.

To integrate authentication into the site, I used the **Firebase** service, implementing through **Google Auth**, the functionality provided by it.

I used this backend service to store the database in realtime for all the subscriptions of users registered in the fitness club, from where I can further manage their request.

The design was implemented based on the Figma resource that I have attached below.

**In the development of the project, the tech stack used was:**

* HTML
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript
